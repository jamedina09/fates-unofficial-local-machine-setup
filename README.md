# FATES (and CTSM) Unofficial Installation Guide on Local Machines - Work-In-Progress

***This guide is a work-in-progress and is not yet complete.***

This repository provides an **unofficial guide** for installing the FATES program on various operating systems. The instructions are divided by platform and software requirements.

I also provide a guide to installing Python and Miniconda on macOS Sonoma here: [Miniconda-Python](./python_config_macos_sonoma.md). This will reduce a couple of headaches when running the model later on.

- **I do not offer support** for this guide or the installation process.
- The guide is (currently) maintained **solely by me**, and updates are made based on my availability.
